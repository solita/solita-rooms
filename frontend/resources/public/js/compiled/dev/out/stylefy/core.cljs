(defn use-style
  "Defines a style for a component by converting the given style map in to an unique CSS class,
   and returning a pointer (a map with :class keyword) to it so that the component can use it.

   Calling use-style does not immediately add the generated CSS class to DOM, because doing this
   in a single render would slow everything down if use-style is called multiple times.
   If the style has not been added into the DOM yet, it also returns the given props as inline style, so that
   the component looks good even if CSS class has not been genererated yet.

   Important exception: if the style contains specific modes or media query definitions,
   {:style {:visibility \"hidden\"}} is returned until the DOM is ready.
   This is done because these definitions cannot be present as inline style.
   If this is a problem, see prepare-styles function.

   The given 'style' parameter is a map which contains CSS style properties
   (as supported by Garden library). There can also be special namespaced keywords
   along with the style definitions:

   ::sub-styles        Makes it possible to define a named style map inside of the main style map.
                       The contents of ::sub-styles should be a map,
                       in which keys define the name of the sub-style and
                       values contain the style properties.
                       Sub-styles are nothing special, they are supposed to contain the same contents
                       as the main style map. ::sub-styles helps you to define styles that are closely
                       related to the main style map but do not deserve their own 'def'.
   ::mode              A map in which keys are mode names and values are style properties.
                       Internally all modes are converted to CSS pseudoclasses. You can use any mode name
                       that is a valid CSS speudoclass.
   ::media             A map in which keys are maps presenting CSS media query definitions, and values
                       are style maps which are used when the media query is active.
   ::vendors           A vector of vendor prefixes that are used with ::auto-prefix.
   ::auto-prefix       A set of style properties that should be prefixed with ::vendors.
   ::with-classes      A collection of additional class names that should always be used with
                       this style definition.

   Options is an optional map, which contains HTML attributes (:class, :href, :src etc.).
   It can also contain the the following features:

   ::with-classes       DEPRECATED. A vector of additional class names used with the current style.
                        Deprecated since version 1.3.0: The options map can now contain
                        any HTML attributes. Thus, you can just use :class instead of ::with-classes."

                              so that future page loads work faster. Defaults to false.
                              Also check :cache-options.
    cache-options             A map which can contain the following keywords:
      expires                 Number of seconds after the cache is cleared automatically.
                              For example, value 604800 clears the cache after one week.
                              By default, the cache is never cleared automatically.
                              You can also clear the cache manually by calling stylefy.cache/clear.
    global-vendor-prefixes    A map containing a set of ::stylefy/vendors and
